## 1.1

it doesn't have time to find the like button in the DOM.

- The script is now on my Github page.

## 1.2

- Change the match meta from "https://www.youtube.com/watch*" to "https://www.youtube.com/*" because
- YT use a JS router and the script was not loaded if you go to a video from the YT home page.

## 1.3

- Change the like button query selector to match the new one.
- Better page navigation handeling.

## 1.4
