# Changelogs

## 1.0

First version of the script

# 1.1

Fix the issue when the like button was not clicked if you quickly go on fullscreen or if it doesn't have time
to find the like button in the DOM.

The script is now on my Github page.

# 1.2

Change the match meta from "https://www.youtube.com/watch*" to "https://www.youtube.com/*" because
YT use a JS router and the script was not loaded if you go to a video from the YT home page.
